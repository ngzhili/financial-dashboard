A streamlit web application to view US stock prices, charts, news and stocktwit discussions.

The application uses yfinance and yahoo_fin library APIs to obtain stock information to be displayed in the streamlit interface.

The streamlit application was deployed on heroku, however the free tier has been removed since 2022, thus this application is now hosted on streamlit.
